QUICK START

This guide should show new users how to get this software up and running under typical use case scenarios:

HOW TO USE THE PROGRAM AS A CONTROL CHANNEL

1) Generate a key pair for the client and the listener/server
	The following command will generate a new key pair:
	"key new"
	The following command will display that key pair:
	"key view"

2) Define the "public" key for the other end node with the following command:
	"key client <the other end node's public key goes here>"

3) Specify a send and receive modes with the "send" and "receive" commands. ICMP
ping is the default, but TCP mode is also available:
	"send icmp" sets the send mode to use ICMP ping
	"send tcp 80" tells the host to send false data to TCP port 80 on the other end
	"receive icmp" sets the receive mode to use ICMP ping
	"receive tcp 80" receive data on TCP port 80

3) Use the "listen" command to put the listner/server into listen mode.
	(alternately, "./needle -k <your public key><your private key><the other guy's public key>" works too)

4) From the client, define the IP address of the server with the "connect" command
	"connect 10.10.10.10"

5) If desired, specify a send mode.

5) Sync the nonce for both ends with the "token" command issued from the client

6) explore the following commands (examples provided in parentheses):
	a) exec (exec ls -al) - executes a command on the listner/server
	b) put (put /tmp/somefile /bin/ls) - uploads a file
	c) get (get /etc/passwd /tmp/passwd) - downloads a file
	d) quit (quit) - ends the session

This program will accept scripted commands from text files. The "-s" option 
allows users to specify scripts. The following file shows what might work
for server/listener mode:

---start---
key public 008abf985b86170a6da351041aaf9f30219867d7485296e6cde6a15ef9573038
key private 85d78dc2d520119ac35483184a2bb53c62f0aea7d7a73a67788d84ea1abc46df
key client 71220ccdb6dd55a67c1c53ee01cb04fd11d4599f3ef3230cd5664f6eb720b13f
send icmp
receive icmp
listen
---stop---

The following script file would configure a client to talk to that host,
assuming its IP address was 10.0.0.1

---start---
key public 71220ccdb6dd55a67c1c53ee01cb04fd11d4599f3ef3230cd5664f6eb720b13f
key private 1162246fced9115a90eb4c9769c5d58a221198010850454077585c7f5525454e
key client 008abf985b86170a6da351041aaf9f30219867d7485296e6cde6a15ef9573038

connect 10.0.0.1
send icmp
receive icmp
token
exec ls -al /
---stop---


CHAT USING STEGANOGRAPHY

1) Establish complimentary key pairs on both nodes.
	key public 008abf985b86170a6da351041aaf9f30219867d7485296e6cde6a15ef9573038
	key private 85d78dc2d520119ac35483184a2bb53c62f0aea7d7a73a67788d84ea1abc46df
	key client 71220ccdb6dd55a67c1c53ee01cb04fd11d4599f3ef3230cd5664f6eb720b13f
2) Type "connect" on both nodes with the single argument being the IP of the other node
	"connect 10.0.0.1" or "connect 10.0.0.2" assuming, users on these two IPs wish to chat
3) Type "chat" on both nodes
	chat
4) Start Typing messages back and forth

PACKET SPOOFING

Users who wish to hide their source address would be advised to do the following:
1) First, use the "connect" command to designate the target
	connect 10.0.0.1
2) Use the "spoof" command to designate your desired IP address of choice
	spoof 192.168.1.254
3) Use the "token" command to tell the server NOT to increment the NONCE
	(sorry about the chat injection)
	token static


NOTES ON SESSION MANAGEMENT

Assuming that the client and the server have complementary key pars in stalled, they will also need 
nonces to be the same. Typically, both ends of the communication will simply increment the nonce at
the same time. However, sometimes this breaks down. If this happens, type the following command
to sync the nonce:

	token

Sometimes, session management gets a little funny, and the receiver will stop talking to you.
If this happens, wait for about one minute. This is the timeout value for building a datagram.
The receiver should reset itself in that time, and then the "token" command should work again.
